//Functional programming is about:

// Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change

// Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

// Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareGreenTea = () => "greenTea";

// Function that returns a string representing a cup of black tea
const prepareBlackTea = () => "blackTea";

/*
Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getTea = (prepareTea, numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for (let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};
