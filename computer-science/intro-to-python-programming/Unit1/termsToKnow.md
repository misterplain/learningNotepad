### Terms to know

Bytecode\
An intermediary step for code conversion between the programming language that you write and the machine code that a computer uses.

Compiler\
A compiler scans an entire program and attempts to convert the whole program at once to machine code.

Input\
Ways a program gets its data; user input through the keyboard, mouse, or other device.

Interpreter\
An interpreter takes the bytecode one line at a time and converts it to machine code.

Machine Code\
Also known as machine language. The computer uses binary (0s and 1s) to perform tasks. At a high level, the programming language code that you write gets translated or compiled to the machine code that the computer understands.

Output\
The results at the end of a program based on user input and system processing.

Processing\
Taking the data inputs and prompts and calculates the results (output).

Program\
A sequence of computer language statements that have been crafted to do something.

Syntax\
The syntax is the “grammar” rules of the programming language. Each programming language (like Python) has its own syntax.

Virtual Machine\
A software program that behaves like a completely separate computer within an application.

Literal String\
A series of characters that are combined together and enclosed in quotes; for example, "Enter in the second number" is a literal string.

Pseudocode\
English-like statements that describe the steps in a program or algorithm.

String\
A data type that can store a literal string as a value.

Variable\
A named memory location that has the ability to hold various distinct values at different points in time in the program.

Algorithm\
A logical step-by-step plan that we need to build for solving a problem.

Comments\
The “#” (hashtag) is used in Python code to identify a comment. Commented lines of code are ignored by the compiler during run time. A programmer adds comments throughout the code to explain how the program or function works.

Module\
A self-contained piece of code that can be used in different programs.

Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\
A text editor that has additional functionality to allow developers to perform some additional tasks to simplify the workflow of the development process.

Libraries/Library\
Prewritten code collections that you can use when developing a program.

Argument\
An argument is an actual value(s) that is being passed into the function when it is being called.

Casting (or Type-Casting)\
Casting is when you convert a variable’s value from one data type to another.

Functions\
A function is a section of code that runs when it is called. We have the ability to pass in data into those functions, which are called parameters.

Methods\
Methods are a specialized type of procedure that’s directly associated with an object and called to perform a specific task by using the object name, a period, and then the method name.

Object\
An object is an instance of a class that has properties and methods that are encapsulated or part of it.

Parameter\
A parameter is the actual variable name(s) when we define a function definition.

float()\
The float() function can create a float number from an integer literal, float literal, or a string literal as long as the string has a float or an integer.

int()\
The int() function creates an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all of the decimals), or a string literal (assuming the string represents a whole number).

len()\
The len() function counts all characters, including punctuation and spaces.

str()\
The str() function creates a string from various data types, including strings, integer literals, and float literals.

Traceback\
A traceback is a list of functions that are executed and printed to the screen when an exception occurs.

Exceptions\
Errors detected during execution (running of the code) are called exceptions.

try and except\
try and except are reserved keywords. The idea of the try and except statements is that you know that some sequence of instruction(s) may have a problem and you want to add some statements to be executed if an error occurs. These extra statements (the except block) are ignored if there is no error.

as\
The as keyword is one of Python’s reserved keywords and simply is used to create an alias.

purpose of try catch is to handle exceptions by executing a specific block of code instead of terminating the program 

1st step is determining the inputs 

nameerror is when variable assigned before it's used

python is an interpreted language

or operator finds first item true = short-curcut

algorithm  = logical step by step plan used to solve a problem 

next step after determining the inputs is determining the outputs
