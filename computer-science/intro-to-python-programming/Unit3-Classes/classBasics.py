# Sequential code - a fancy way to state lines of code that do something in sequence.
# Conditional code - using if, else, and elif statements to check for certain conditions and act on those conditions when found (or not found).
# Repetitive code - Using for and while loops to repeat a process or move through a data collection type.
# Reusable code - Using either built-in or user-created functions to perform tasks that can be utilized either once or multiple times once they are created.
