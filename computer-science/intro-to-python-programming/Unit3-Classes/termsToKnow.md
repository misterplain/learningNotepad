Object-Oriented Programming
Object-oriented programming (or OOP for short) is a programming model that organizes the design of code by bundling objects.

Class Instantiation
The process of creating an instance of a class which is called an object.

Attributes
Attributes are data defined in the class template and are the characteristics or properties of an object.

class
The class keyword defines the data and code that will make up each of the objects. When defining a class, it starts with the class keyword and is then followed by the name of the class and a colon.

.
The (.) (dot) operator connects the object (instance of a class) to the attributes and methods of that object.

The class keyword defines the data and code that will make up each of the objects. When defining a class, it starts with the class keyword and is then followed by the name of the class and a colon.

_ _init_ _
The _ _init_ _ method’s sole purpose is to initialize (assign values) to the object’s attributes and it is only used within a class.

del
The del keyword is used to delete objects, and since everything in Python is an object, we can use this keyword to delete anything, including variables, lists, etc.

Inheritance
Inheritance is a relationship model that allows us to define a class that inherits all the attributes and methods from another class.

Base Class
The base class is also known as the parent class. It is the class that is being inherited from.

Subclass
The subclass is also known as the child class. It is the class that inherits from another class. A subclass is known to “extend” the base class, meaning that it can define additional data that will not affect the base class.

super()
The super() function allows a subclass to access the base class attributes and methods.

Name Collisions
Name collisions occur when similar named objects are used in multiple scopes that mean different things.

_ _main_ _
The _ _main_ _ function is the name of the top-level program in Python. The top level is the first user specified module that runs when a program is being executed.

global
The reserved keyword global allows the modification of a variable outside of the current scope.

help()
Python has a built-in help() function that you can use with any class to get more information about that class.

Method Resolution Order
If a class has a method that exists in multiple classes, the method resolution order tells us which classes will be looked at first.

_ _dict_ _
The _ _dict_ _ method contains a dictionary collection of all of the attributes and methods for that object.

Python Standard Library
The Python Standard Library is composed of collections of built-in modules that provide access to system functionality and standardized solutions that Python programmers can utilize when developing programs.

Packages
Packages are a collection of one or more modules that are typically related in functionality.

import
The import reserved keyword is used to import modules.

dir()
The dir() (directory) function returns the content of the object including all properties and methods without the values.

from
The from reserved keyword is used to import only a specified method or property from a module.

random()
The random() function returns a float value greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0.

randint()
The randint() function returns a random integer that’s equal to or between the two values that are supplied as arguments.

randrange()
The randrange() function returns a random integer value within the range of integers that’s specified.

Central Processing Unit
The Central Processing Unit is the heart of any computer. It is what runs the software that we write; it is also called the “CPU” or the “processor”.

Main Memory
The Main Memory is used to store information that the CPU needs in a hurry. Main memory is nearly as fast as the CPU. The CPU and memory are where our software works and runs.

Secondary Memory
Secondary Memory is also used to store information, but it is much slower than the Main Memory. The advantage of the Secondary Memory is that it can store information even when there is no power to the computer.

open()
The open() function returns a file object. The open() function contains options for reading the content of the file.

File Handle
The file handle is not the actual data contained in the file, but instead, it is a “handle” that we can use to read the data.

.read()
The .read() method reads the entire file and returns the entire contents as a string.

.write()
The .write() method of the file handle object writes a specified text to the file, returning the number of characters written.
