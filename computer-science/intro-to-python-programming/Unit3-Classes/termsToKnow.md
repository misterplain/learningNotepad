Object-Oriented Programming
Object-oriented programming (or OOP for short) is a programming model that organizes the design of code by bundling objects.

Class Instantiation
The process of creating an instance of a class which is called an object.

Attributes
Attributes are data defined in the class template and are the characteristics or properties of an object.

class
The class keyword defines the data and code that will make up each of the objects. When defining a class, it starts with the class keyword and is then followed by the name of the class and a colon.

.
The (.) (dot) operator connects the object (instance of a class) to the attributes and methods of that object.

_ _init_ _
The _ _init_ _ method’s sole purpose is to initialize (assign values) to the object’s attributes and it is only used within a class.

del
The del keyword is used to delete objects, and since everything in Python is an object, we can use this keyword to delete anything, including variables, lists, etc.

Inheritance
Inheritance is a relationship model that allows us to define a class that inherits all the attributes and methods from another class.

Base Class
The base class is also known as the parent class. It is the class that is being inherited from.

Subclass
The subclass is also known as the child class. It is the class that inherits from another class. A subclass is known to “extend” the base class, meaning that it can define additional data that will not affect the base class.

super()
The super() function allows a subclass to access the base class attributes and methods.
